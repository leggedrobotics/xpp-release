Description: Xpp is a package for the visualization of motion plans for floating-base robots.
 Apart from drawing support areas, contact forces and motion trajectories in RVIZ, it also displays these plans for specific robots. Current robots include a one-legged, a two-legged hopper, HyQ and a quadrotor.
